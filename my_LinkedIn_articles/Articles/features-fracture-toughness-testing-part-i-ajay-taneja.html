  <h3><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction:</strong></h3> 
  <p>&nbsp;</p> 
  <p>This article is&nbsp;the continuation of my series of blogs on "Fracture Mechanics".</p> 
  <p>In my earlier article: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/crack-initiation-life-estimation-part-ii-ajay-taneja" target="_blank">https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/crack-initiation-life-estimation-part-ii-ajay-taneja</a> ; I had discussed about the effect of plasticity on crack growth. It was evident following the discussion that plasticity proves to be very effective / beneficial for fracture mechanics.</p> 
  <p>I had tried to elucidate that in case of a fatigue loading of many cycles, there is always a plastic zone developed around the crack tip during a cycle of loading (see figure below). And then, during the consequent unloading, as the elastic region springs back, it exerts a pressure on (a much smaller) plastic zone resulting in a residual compression around the plastic zone. The presence of this residual compression was indeed the reason for an early crack closure (prior to the load becoming zero) and thus resulting in retardation of crack growth and hence resulting in increase in fracture toughness (depending upon the size of the plastic zone, magnitude of residual compression). Thus, it was clear that ‘<em>plasticity is a friend of fracture mechanics’</em></p>

  <p><strong>Figure: Increase in size of plastic zone with increase in number of cycles of load</strong></p> 
  <p>The beneficial effects of plasticity were not known when the research on fracture mechanics was in early progress during the 1950’s. In fact, early tests during 1950’s to test fracture in metals were on <strong>thin</strong> specimen. And it was only in 1960 that Irwin demonstrated that <strong>thick</strong> specimen have markedly lower fracture toughness than <strong>thin </strong>specimen (of the same material). Although, the explanation of the phenomenon was not correctly understood then, Irwin correctly attributed the effect to plane strain and consequently the decreased effect of plastic zone. Then, the experiments revealed that the fracture toughness in case of plane strain is far below than what one would observe in plane stress. The intuitive understanding was provided by Irwin and later on the result was validated with experiments and explanation.</p> 
  <p>With the above background, this article will focus on perhaps a topic which is regarded as a bit <em>dry and uninteresting</em> in the field of fracture mechanics – <em>fracture toughness testing</em>. However, contrarily, I feel that if approached with the right understanding, right background and in the right order, this is actually a very interesting subject! Section 2 of this article is a discussion on the evolution of research and thus standards dealing with fracture toughness testing. Some more details on the content of some of the standards: E399, B645, E1820 are summarized in section 6</p> 
  <p>Section 3 describes how fracture toughness may vary as specimen thickness using examples of steel and aluminium materials.</p> 
  <p>Section 4 begins to go into details of plane strain fracture toughness testing. To start with: I’ve just listed the minimum requirements that must be satisfied for a successful plane strain fracture toughness test and then described the various specimens used for plane strain fracture toughness testing and the corresponding analytical expressions for stress intensity factor.</p> 
  <p>Section 5 elaborates on the minimum requirements for a plane strain fracture toughness test (that were listed in section 4) and finally section 6 (as stated above) summarizes the content of some of the prevailing standards.&nbsp;</p> 
  <p>I’ve planned to discuss the topic in 2 parts. Whereas, the current article elaborates on the plane strain fracture toughness test, the next blog will focus on plane stress fracture toughness testing.</p> 
  <p>&nbsp;</p> 
  <h3><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evolution of fracture toughness standards:</strong></h3> 
  <p>&nbsp;</p> 
  <p><em>The plane strain fracture toughness KIC is defined – as per ASTM E1823 – as the crack-extension resistance under conditions of crack-tip plane strain in mode I for slow rates of loading under predominantly linear elastic conditions and negligible plastic-zone adjustment</em></p> 
  <p>The test procedures for measuring fracture toughness of materials have been developed and standardised by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) in the United States. In 1958, a special ASTM Technical Committee E24 on Fracture Testing of Metals was established for the purpose to develop and write test methods for the determination of fracture properties.</p> 
  <p>As indicated in the introduction section, much of the early fracture testing was directed at relatively thin sections and the procedures described in the ASTM E24 committee reports dealt almost entirely with thin-section problems. It was later indicated that thickness-dependent apparent toughness Kc might not be a single value property, and thickness-independent plane strain toughness KIC might be a more fundamental property of materials. Thus, the committee effort shifted from thin section problem to concentration on thick section problem to develop test methods for determining KIC. It was anticipated that once the plane strain problem was solved, attention would return to the thin section (or, plane stress) problem</p> 
  <p>&nbsp;</p> 
  <p>Srawley and Brown at the NASA Lewis Research Centre in Cleveland contributed much to establish a standard for KIC testing (plane strain fracture toughness), including: details of specimen design, specimen size requirement, fatigue pre-cracking, test procedure and other details. On these basis, the ASTM technical committee E24 proposed a draft of test method for plane strain fracture toughness KIC testing in 1996 and then standardized with designation E399-70T. This standard was officiated in 1972. Thus, it took about <strong>10 years</strong> to establish the <strong>first ASTM fracture standard E399 – 72</strong> that became the model for all subsequent ASTM standards and all international standards.</p> 
  <p>After a substantial amount of progress was made on the KIC testing of thick specimen test geometries, the attention was refocussed in the 1970’s on the KIC testing for thin sections where plane stress condition prevails.</p> 
  <p>The discussion – on the prevailing standards is continued in section 6 (the last section of this article) further as I felt it’d be worthwhile to discuss some detail on how a plane strain fracture toughness is conducted, what are the restrictions, concept of candidate fracture toughness before elaborating more on standards.</p> 
  <h3><strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fracture toughness as a function of specimen thickness:</strong></h3> 
  <p>In comparison to a simple tension test, the laboratory test to measure fracture toughness is much more involved and several requirements are to be met with.</p> 
  <p>Firstly, the fracture toughness, as discussed above is a function of specimen thickness and thus there are different values of fracture toughness in situations of plane stress and plane strain. Since&nbsp;fracture toughness being a function of specimen thickness, suppose if there is a structure / component which is in a plane stress situation and if one is using fracture toughness value of plane strain case, it will result in very conservative values and over-design of the structural component. The procedure for measuring of fracture toughness in plane strain situations is well documented in the standards as briefly elaborated in the section 2 of this article. Whereas, the procedure for measuring fracture toughness in plane stress situations is still developing further and a number of parameters – including the panel width come into play in case of plane stress situation.</p> 
  <p>It should be underscored that fracture toughness remains a material property in case of plane strain situations only whereas in case of plane stress geometry parameters as panel width also comes into play.</p> 
  <p>The figures below show the variation of fracture toughness for steel and aluminium. It can be observed that in case of steel, the fracture toughness varies from 200MPa√m for a 10mm thick specimen to 120 MPa√m for a 50 mm thick specimen. Whereas for aluminium the variation of fracture toughness is from 70 MPa√m for a 5mm thick specimen to 35 MPa√m for a 15mm thick specimen.</p> 
  <p>Thus, one can see that in case of steel the fracture toughness in transition from plane stress to plane strain stabilises at 50 mm whereas in aluminium it stabilises as early as 15mm! This is important to note because if a material scientist has invented a new material, then, a prior he will not know the minimum thickness that is necessary for conducting a plane strain fracture toughness test. This makes the plane strain fracture toughness iterative with regards to the minimum thickness to establish plane strain behaviour and thus making the test complex when compared to a simple tension test!</p>

  <p><strong>Figure: Variation of fracture toughness with the thickness of the specimen&nbsp;</strong></p> 
  <h3><strong>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conducting a fracture toughness test: Plane strain</strong></h3> 
  <p>&nbsp;</p> 
  <p><strong>4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fracture toughness as a material property:</strong></p> 
  <p>As stated in the preceding sections, fracture toughness becomes a material property only when plane strain conditions are met in the experiment. Firstly, this imposes a minimum requirement on the specimen thickness – for a new material this value of minimum thickness has to be obtained by trial and error. For a plane strain fracture toughness test to be valid, standards recommend to do the test with a natural crack. Special notches are recommended to get a natural crack under fatigue loading. There are also restrictions on fatigue loading i.e. the fatigue loading should not result in a excessive plastic zone. Thus, an appropriate range of fatigue loading should be selected. This is elaborated in section.</p> 
  <p>&nbsp;</p> 
  <p><strong>4.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minimum requirements of a fracture toughness test:</strong></p> 
  <p>Based on the above, standards (ASTM E399-06 for metallic materials and ASTM B645 – 06 for aluminium alloys) recommend minimum requirements based on the following considerations;</p> 
  <p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;Constraints on specimen dimensions</p> 
  <p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatigue pre-cracking restrictions</p> 
  <p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;Loading rate recommendations</p> 
  <p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluation of fatigue pre-crack</p> 
  <p>Generally, the KIC determined from the fracture toughness test is labelled as KC – called the “candidate fracture toughness”. Only after all the requirements for the test are met and it is accepted, the value is termed as KIC. Evaluation of the parameters following the test is unique to fracture toughness testing.</p> 
  <p>&nbsp;</p> 
  <p><strong>4.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specimen for fracture toughness test</strong></p> 
  <p>The basic philosophy in selecting the specimen used for fracture toughness testing is that, only that specimen should be used for which analytical expressions for stress intensity factor exist. During the experiment, one will be able to compute the load at which the fracture occurs and then from the given geometry of the specimen compute the stress intensity factor which will essentially be the “candidate fracture toughness”.</p> 
  <p>The specimens recommended by the standards (ASTM E-399) include the following;</p> 
  <p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;Compact Tension (CT) specimen</p> 
  <p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;Three point bend specimen (TPB specimen)</p> 
  <p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;C-spcimen</p> 
  <p>The bend specimen (TPB) and the compact tension (CT) specimen are general purpose specimens whereas the C specimen was specifically designed for fracture toughness testing of cylinders and thick bars.</p>

  </div> 
  <p><strong> Figure: Compact tension specimen</strong></p> 
  <p>The dimensions of the standard specimens should be such that the depth (W) should be twice the width (B). For the bend specimen, the width ‘B’ may be taken between 0.25 W and W and for compact tension specimen, it is taken between B = 0.25W and B = 0.5 W.</p> 
  <p>&nbsp;</p> 
  <p><strong>4.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Analytical expressions for the stress intensity factor for the above specimens:</strong></p> 
  <p>As mentioned, in section 4.3, it is required that the analytical expression for the stress intensity factor for the specimen is known so that once the fracture toughness test is completed and hence the specimen broken, the value of the ultimate load may be substituted in the expression for the stress in intensity factor to obtain the <strong><em>candidate fracture toughness.</em></strong></p> 
  <p>The analytical expression for the stress intensity factor for the bend specimen is given by (symbols as shown in the figure above);</p>

  <p>Due to the larger range of validity, the expressions by Srawley have become general purpose expressions and are widely adopted for research and experimental findings.</p>

  <h3><strong>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minimum requirements of a fracture toughness test:</strong></h3> 
  <p><strong>Constraints on specimen dimensions</strong></p> 
  <p>This section elaborates- in detail the minimum requirements of a plane strain fracture toughness test (that were listed in section 4.1)</p> 
  <p><strong>Specimen thickness: </strong></p> 
  <p>I had elaborated in my earlier article <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/modelling-plastic-deformation-within-regime-linear-elastic-taneja" target="_blank"><em>https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/modelling-plastic-deformation-within-regime-linear-elastic-taneja</em></a> on the modelling of plastic zone within the regime of linear elastic fracture mechanics it was concluded (well, <em>approximately) </em>that the plastic zone size is proportional to:</p>

  <p>where, α &gt; 2.5</p> 
  <p>The condition is necessary to maintain plane strain condition during fracture toughness testing. It is also interesting to note the minimum thickness required to maintain plane strain conditions for different materials.</p> 
  <p>For an Aluminium high strength alloy, the minimum thickness to maintain plane strain condition is around 15 mm whereas for nuclear grade steel, the specimen size (if plane strain condition is to be achieved during fracture toughness testing) the specimen size should be &gt; = 1020 mm. (!). Thus, achieving plans strain condition for nuclear grade steel is practically not possible and hence EPFM (elasto-plastic fracture mechanics) is generally resorted to for nuclear grade steel.</p>

  <p>It can be seen that as the yield strength of the material increases the thickness required to achieve plane strain condition (hence, minimal effect of plasticity) decreases. Linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) is ideally suited for high strength alloys.</p> 
  <p><strong>Fatigue pre-cracking:</strong></p> 
  <p>As stated in section 4.1, the specimen has to be provided with a fatigue pre-crack before carrying out the final experimentation. In order to ensure that the cracking occurs in the right place, the specimens are provided with a notch – a <strong>chevron notch</strong> as shown in the figure below,</p>

  <p><strong>Fatigue pre-cracking restrictions:</strong></p> 
  <p>In order to get a fatigue pre-crack, there are restrictions with the primary aim that a plane strain condition is achieved and that plastic zone developed is negligible. These include;</p> 
  <p>i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During any stage of fatigue crack growth, Kmax shall not exceed 0.8KQ where KQ is the candidate fracture toughness.</p> 
  <p>ii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A high K may blunt the crack tip too much leading to excessive plastic zone</p> 
  <p>iii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last 2.5% of crack length should be loaded such that;</p> 
  <p>And</p> 
  <p>Where, E is the Young’s modulus</p> 
  <p><strong>Experimental procedure:</strong></p> 
  <p>Once the fatigue pre-crack is developed, the specimen is ready for the final experimental procedure to get the value of the candidate fracture toughness (KQ). It is interesting to note that the final experimental procedure is done under monotonic loading and the specimen is loaded&nbsp;until it fractures. Following are some of the restrictions to be carried out during the final experimentation;</p> 
  <p>i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special fixtures are used to load the pre-cracked specimen</p> 
  <p>ii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loading rate is maintained at: 0.55 – 2.75 MPa√m / second.</p> 
  <p>iii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specimen is tested until it can sustain no further load.</p> 
  <p>iv.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clip gauge is used to measure crack mouth opening displacement (CMOD)</p> 
  <p>v.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Measuring the load at fracture: In the load vs. CMOD curve as shown in the figure below, it can be observed that close to the fracture there is a kink in the curve and in case of curve of this fashion, the maximum load PQ is taken for which the candidate fracture toughness is determined from the analytical expression;</p>

  <p><strong>Measurement and acceptance criterion for crack length</strong></p> 
  <p>Finally, once the specimen is broken, there are a set of requirements on the measurement of the crack length and the consequent acceptance criterion.</p> 
  <p>i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For measuring the crack length, 3 measurements are to be taken: one at the centre of the notch and the others on either side as shown in the figure below;</p>

  <p>The acceptance criteria as specified by the standard is that the difference between any 3 crack size measurements should not exceed 10 % of “a”.</p>

  <p>ii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, there is a restriction on the length of the crack that emerges out of the chevron. The standards that the crack should emerge out from both the surfaces of the chevron and the value should be greater than 0.025 w or 1.3 mm (the larger of the 2 values). The difference between the crack length between the 2 surfaces should not be more than 10 % of the crack length “a” (see figure below):</p>

  <p><strong>E 399: </strong>If one looks at the features of E399-06, it will be realized that it is an unusual standard so that a valid test cannot be ensured to start with. Firstly, one needs to arrive at the candidate fracture toughness KQ and if KQ satisfies all the restrictions in terms of the specimen dimensions, crack length, pre-fatigue racking restrictions then the candidate fracture toughness may be classified as fracture toughness (i.e. final correct fracture toughness value).</p> 
  <p>As per the standard, one only records only 2 parameters: load applied and the crack mouth opening displacement with a clip gauge. Thus, there are only 2 measurements that are taken but initially a fatigue loading is done to generate fatigue cracks. The actual test is done through a monotonic loading (not cyclic) and the loading rate is dictated by the standard.</p> 
  <p>Suppose the test becomes invalid, E399 suggests repeating the test with specimen size 50 % larger than the thickness.</p> 
  <p><strong>B645 : </strong>Whereas, E399 is a standard for testing of plane strain fracture toughness of metallic materials, B645 is for plane strain fracture toughness of aluminium alloys only. In E399, if the test becomes invalid considering the specimen dimensions, crack length or fatigue pre-cracking restrictions, the test results are of no use and the test has to be repeated. B645 offers some relaxation in this regard so that some of the results of invalid test can be salvaged and used effectively.</p> 
  <p>&nbsp;</p> 
  <p><strong>E1820 : </strong>E1820 is a generalisation of E399. At the expense of additional instrumentation and some increases complexity in test procedure. It provides the means for reporting additional measures of fracture when plane-strain toughness is not an appropriate parameter. The standard provides reporting other parameters such as CTOD and J integral.</p>
