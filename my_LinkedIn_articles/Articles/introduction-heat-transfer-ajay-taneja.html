  <h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;1. INTRODUCTION</h2> 
  <p>The aim of this write-up is to illustrate the fundamental concepts and principles that underlie the heat transfer processes.</p> 
  <p>Section 2 of this article briefly describes the heat transfer modes: conduction, convection and radiation.</p> 
  <p>Section 3 explains the physical origins of these modes and the rate equations involved in the heat transfer carried out through conduction, convection, radiation. The phenomenon of conduction is elaborated (with an emphasis to get a physical insight)&nbsp;through an example of a gas that occupies a space between two surfaces at different temperatures which results in heat transfer through the transfer of energy from the more energetic to the less energetic molecules. &nbsp;The concepts of velocity, thermal and concentration boundary layer have been discussed whilst elaborating on the physics of heat transfer by convection.</p> 
  <p>Section 4 provides lays emphasis on the definition, physical and the mathematical interpretation of the fundamental and the subsidiary laws of physics which form the basis of the subject of heat transfer. It may be noted that whether it is the governing differential equation concerning heat transfer through conduction or the governing differential equations for convective heat transfer, these equations are formulated through these laws. Hence, it is felt that a clear understanding of these laws is imperative.</p> 
  <p>Section&nbsp;5 brings out the importance / relevance of the study of heat transfer by pointing out examples in the gas turbine industry, electronics and biomedical engineering where the heat transfer study plays a significant role.</p> 
  <h2>2. Heat transfer: definition and modes of heat transfer</h2> 
  <h3>&nbsp;</h3> 
  <h3>2.1 Definition of heat transfer:</h3> 
  <p>Heat transfer (or heat) may be defined as the thermal energy in transit due to a spatial temperature difference.</p> 
  <h3>2.2 Modes of heat transfer:</h3> 
  <p>The different types of heat transfer processes as illustrated in the figure below may be referred to as <em>modes</em>.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;<strong>Figure: Conduction, convection and radiation modes of heat transfer</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Conduction:</strong></p> 
  <p>When a temperature gradient exists in a stationary medium, which may be a solid or a liquid or a gas, we use the term “conduction” to refer to the heat transfer that will occur across the medium.</p> 
  <p><strong>Convection:</strong></p> 
  <p>In contrast to conduction, convection refers to the heat transfer that will occur between a surface and a moving fluid when they are at different temperatures.</p> 
  <p><strong>Thermal radiation:</strong></p> 
  <p>The third mode of heat transfer is thermal radiation. All surfaces at a finite temperature emit energy in the form of electromagnetic waves. Hence, in the absence of intervening medium, there is net heat transfer between two surfaces at different temperatures.</p> 
  <h2><strong>3. Physical origins and rate equations</strong></h2> 
  <p>&nbsp;This section explains the physical mechanisms which underlie the heat transfer modes and to illustrate the rate equations that quantify the amount of heat transfer per unit time.</p> 
  <h3><strong>3.1 Conduction</strong></h3> 
  <p>&nbsp;Conduction may be viewed as the transfer of energy from more energetic to the less energetic particles of a substance due to interaction between the particles.</p> 
  <p>The physical mechanism of conduction can be explained by considering a gas in which a temperature gradient exists, and assume that there is no bulk or macroscopic, motion.</p> 
  <p>The gas may occupy space between two surfaces that are maintained at different temperatures as shown in the figure below.C</p> 
  <div class="slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width"> 
   <img data-media-urn="urn:li:digitalmediaAsset:C5112AQH0xebCm8C84Q" src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5112AQH0xebCm8C84Q/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1520171681141?e=1691625600&amp;v=beta&amp;t=PZK6AWjDKyxe5AAqlcqsYJWMel3m7op0Kg0czpCUSS8"> 
  </div> 
  <p class="center"><strong>Figure: Association of conduction heat transfer with the diffusion of energy due to conduction heat transfer</strong></p> 
  <p>&nbsp;The molecules of the gas are in motion: translatory, rotational as well as well as vibrational motion i.e. the molecules of the gas translate, rotate and vibrate. When the neighboring molecules collide- as they are constantly doing, a transfer of energy from the more energetic to the less energetic molecules occurs. In the presence of a temperature gradient, energy transfer by conduction must then occur in the direction of decreasing temperature. This would be true even in the absence of collisions.</p> 
  <p>The hypothetical plane at xo (in the above picture) is constantly being crosses by molecules from above due to their random motion. However, the molecules from above are associated with a higher temperature than those from below, in which case there must be a net transfer of energy in the positive x direction. The collisions between the molecules enhance this energy transfer.</p> 
  <p>The situation is similar in a liquid, although the molecules are more closely spaced and the molecular interactions are stronger and more frequent.</p> 
  <p>Similarly, in a solid, the conduction may be attributed to the atomic activity in the form of lattice vibrations.</p> 
  <h3>&nbsp;<strong>3.1.1 Quantification of heat conduction</strong></h3> 
  <p>&nbsp;Heat transfer processes can be quantified in terms of appropriate equations. These equations may be used to compute the amount of energy being transferred per unit time. For heat conduction, the rate equation is termed as Fourier’s law.</p> 
  <p class="left">For the one dimensional plane wall as shown in the figure below, having a temperature distribution T (x), the rate equation is given by;</p>

  <p>&nbsp;The heat flux qx’’ (W / m2) is the heat transfer rate in the x direction per unit area perpendicular to the direction of transfer and it is proportional to the temperature gradient, dT / dx in this direction. The parameter k is a transport property known as <em>thermal conductivity</em> (W / m. K) and is a characteristic of the wall material.</p> 
  <p>The minus sign is a convention denoting that heat is transferred in the direction of decreasing temperature. Under steady state conditions, where the temperature distribution is linear, the temperature gradient may be expressed as;</p>

  <p>&nbsp;It should be noted that the above equation provides a heat flux, that is, the rate of heat transfer per unit area. The heat rate by conduction, qx (Watt), through a plane wall of area A is then the product of the flux and the area, i.e. qx = qx’’ . A</p> 
  <h3><strong>3.2 Convection</strong></h3> 
  <p>&nbsp;The convection heat transfer mode is comprised of two mechanisms. In addition to the transfer due to the random molecular motion (diffusion) is in the conduction process, energy is also transferred by the bulk or the macroscopic motion of the fluid.</p> 
  <p>This fluid motion is associated with the fact that, at any instant, large number of molecules are moving collectively or as aggregates. Such motion in the presence of temperature gradient contributes to heat transfer. Because the molecules in the aggregate retain their random motion, the total heat transfer is then due to a superposition of energy transport by the random motion of the molecules and by the bulk motion of the fluid.</p> 
  <p>Convective heat transfer occurs between a fluid in motion and a bounding surface when the two are at different temperatures.</p> 
  <h3>3.2.1 Hydrodynamic or the velocity boundary layer</h3> 
  <p>&nbsp;Consider the fluid flow over the heated surface as shown in the figure below. A consequence of the fluid surface interaction is the development of a region in the fluid through which the velocity varies from zero at the surface to a finite value u associated with the flow. This region of the fluid is known as the <em>hydrodynamic</em> or the <em>velocity </em>boundary layer.</p> 
  <div class="slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width"> 
   <img data-media-urn="urn:li:digitalmediaAsset:C5112AQGtI2rS8t1wNw" src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5112AQGtI2rS8t1wNw/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/0/1520168259223?e=1691625600&amp;v=beta&amp;t=cDQIUrmMw8MgA1rue4M6a8ww9Z-QJhOKdXLW8v3h3Hw">

  <p><strong>Figure: Boundary layer development in convective heat transfer</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>Figure: One dimensional heat transfer by conduction</strong></p> 
  <h3>3.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thermal boundary layer</h3> 
  <p>&nbsp;If the surface and the flow temperatures differ, there will be a region through which temperature varies from Ts at y =0 to T in the outer flow. This region is called the thermal boundary layer, may be smaller or larger or the same size as that through which the velocity varies. In any case, if Ts &gt; T, convective heat transfer will occur from the surface to the outer flow.</p> 
  <p>Convective heat transfer mode is sustained both by random molecular motion and by the bulk motion of the fluid within the boundary layer. The contribution due to the random molecular motion (diffusion) dominates near the surface where the fluid velocity is low. In fact, at the interface between the surface and the fluid (y = 0), the fluid velocity is zero, and the heat is transferred by this mechanism only. The contribution due to the bulk fluid motion originates from the fact that the boundary layer grows as the fluid velocity progresses in the x- direction.</p> 
  <h3>&nbsp;3.2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Forced and free (natural) convection</h3> 
  <p>&nbsp;Convection heat transfer may be classified according to the nature of the flow. <em>Forced convection</em> is when the flow is caused by external means, such as by a fan, pump or atmospheric winds.</p> 
  <p>In contrast, for free (or natural convection), the flow is induced by buoyancy forces, which are due to density differences caused by temperature variations in the fluid.</p> 
  <p>Above, the convective heat transfer occuring within the fluid due to combined effects of conduction and bulk fluid motion have been described. However, for some convective proceses, there is, in addition, latent heat exchange.</p> 
  <p>This latent heat exchange is asscoaited with a phase change between the liquid and vapour states of the fluid. Two sepcial cases worth a mention being: boiling and condensation. For example, convection heat tarsnfer results from the fluid motion induced by vapour bubbles generated at the bottom of a pan of boiling water or by condensation of water vapour on the outer surface of a cold water pipe.</p>

  <p>Regardless of the nature of the convection heat transfer process, the appropriate heat equation is of the form;</p>

  <p>Where;</p> 
  <p>q’’ is the convective heat flux (W /m2) is proportional to the difference between the surface and the surrounding fluid temperature Tand T respectively. The expression is known as Newton’s law of cooling and the parameter h (W/m2 .K) is termed as the convective heat transfer coefficient.</p> 
  <p>The coefficient depends upon the conditions in the boundary layer, which are influenced by the surface geometry, the nature of the fluid motion and an assortment of fluid thermodynamic and transport properties.</p> 
  <h3>&nbsp;<strong>3.3&nbsp;Radiation</strong></h3> 
  <p>&nbsp;Thermal radiation is the energy emitted by matter that is at non-zero temperature. Radiation may be emitted from solid surface or liquids or gases. The energy of radiation is transported by electromagnetic waves (or alternatively, photons). While the transfer of energy by conduction or convection requires presence of material medium, radiation does not. In fact, radiation occurs most efficiently in a vacuum.</p> 
  <p>Consider radiation transfer processes for the surface of the figure shown below;</p>

  <h2><strong>4.&nbsp; Relevance of heat transfer</strong></h2> 
  <p>&nbsp;</p> 
  <p>A few examples as illustrated below illustrate the rich breadth of applications in which heat transfer plays a critical role.</p> 
  <ol> 
   <li>The efficiency of a gas turbine engine can be significantly increased by increasing its operating temperature. The temperature of the combustion gases inside the engines far exceeds the melting point of the exotic alloys used to manufacture the turbine blades and vanes. Safe operation is typically achieved by three means;</li> 
  </ol> 
  <p>&nbsp;</p> 
  <p>i. Firstly, relatively cools gases are injected through small holes at the leading edge of the turbine blade. The gases hug the blade and as they are carried downstream, they help downstream they help insulate the blade from the hot combustion gases.</p> 
  <p>&nbsp;ii. Secondly thin layers of low conductivity, ceramic thermal barrier coating are applied to the blades to provide an extra layer of insulation. These coatings are produced by spraying molten ceramic powders onto the engine components using extremely high temperature sources such as <em>plasma spray guns (</em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_spraying" target="_blank"><em>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_spraying</em></a><em>) </em> that can operate in excess of 10,000 kelvins.</p> 
  <p>iii. Thirdly, the blade and the vanes are designed with intricate, internal cooling passages, all carefully configures by the heat transfer engineer to allow the gas turbine engine to operate at such extreme conditions.</p>

  <p>3. Recent advances in <em>biomedical engineering</em>, such as laser surgery, have been enabled by successfully applying heat transfer principles. While increased temperatures resulting from contact with hot objects may cause thermal burns, beneficial hypothermal treatments are being used to purposely destroy, for example, cancerous lesions.</p> 
  <p>&nbsp;In a similar manner, very low temperatures might induce <em>frostbite</em>, but purposeful localised freezing can selectively destroy diseased tissue during cryosurgery / cryotherapy.</p> 
  <p>Many medical therapies and devices therefore operate by destructively heating or cooling diseased tissue, while leaving the surrounding healthy tissue unaffected.</p> 
  <h2><strong>4.&nbsp; The Laws of Heat Transfer</strong></h2> 
  <p>&nbsp;</p> 
  <p>Like all subjects in the physical sciences, the foundations of heat transfer rests on a number of fundamental and subsidiary laws. When we say, fundamental laws, it means, that, these laws can be explained and the necessary governing equations derived from the forts principles. Whereas, the subsidiary laws are more empirical in nature and the governing equations are derived from the experimental / observed phenomenon unlike the fundamental laws.</p> 
  <p>The aim of this section is to clearly explain these laws both from the physical and the math point of view.</p> 
  <p>The fundamental laws include,</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>the law of conservation of mass,</li> 
   <li>Newton’s second law of motion,</li> 
   <li>The first law of thermodynamics.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>Whereas, the subsidiary laws include;</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Fourier’s law of heat conduction</li> 
   <li>Newton’s law of cooling</li> 
   <li>The law of thermal radiation</li> 
   <li>Stokes stress rate of strain relation</li> 
   <li>Equation of state.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>The laws listed above; will be clearly discussed in this section.</p> 
  <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Law of conservation of mass</strong></p> 
  <p>The continuity equation (as widely termed in the subject of fluid mechanics) is an expression of principle of mass conservation. It is a statement that the fluid mass is conserved: all fluid particles that flow into any fluid region must flow out i.e. the mass of the system of the fluid remains constant.</p> 
  <p>To obtain this equation, we consider a cubical control volume inside a fluid. Mass conservation requires that the net flow through the control volume is zero.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;<strong>Newton’s second law:</strong></p> 
  <p>The second fundamental law that is pertinent to the flow of a viscous fluid is Newton’s second law of motion. For a differential control volume, this requirement states that the sum of all the forces acting on the control volume must equal the net rate at which momentum leaves the control volume (outflow – inflow).</p> 
  <p>Two kinds of forces may act on the fluid;</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Body forces which are proportional to the volume</li> 
   <li>Surface forces which are proportional to the area</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>&nbsp;Gravitational, centrifugal, magnetic may contribute to the body force and we designate the x and y components of this force as X and Y respectively.</p> 
  <p>Surface forces are due to fluid static pressure as well as due to viscous stresses. At any point in a fluid, the viscous stress may be resolved into two perpendicular components: a normal stress σ and a shear stress τ as shown in the figure below.</p>

Accordingly, for the x surface for the figure above, the normal stress σxx corresponds to a force component normal to the surface and the shear stress τ corresponds to a force in the y direction.</p>

  <p><strong>The First law of thermodynamics</strong></p> 
  <p>The first law of thermodynamics, also known as the conservation of energy principle, states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed; it can only change forms. Therefore, every bit of energy must be accounted for during a process.</p> 
  <p>The conservation of energy principle (or the energy balance) for any system undergoing any process may be expressed as: <em>The net change (increase or decrease) in the total energy of the system during process is equal to the difference between the total energy entering and the total energy leaving the system during that process.</em></p>

  <p>&nbsp;<em>Energy balance for steady flow systems:</em></p> 
  <p>A large number of engineering devices such as water heaters and car radiators involve mass flow in and out of a system, and are modelled as <em>control volumes</em>. Most control volumes are analysed under steady operating conditions. The term steady means <em>no change with time</em> at a specified location. The opposite of steady is unsteady or transient.</p> 
  <p>The total energy content of a control volume during a <em>steady flow process</em> remains constant. That is, the change in the total energy of the control volume during such a process is zero (Δ E = constant). Thus, the amount of energy entering a control volume in all forms (heat, work and mass transfer) for a steady flow process must equal the amount of energy leaving it.</p> 
  <p>The amount of mass flowing through a cross section of a flow device per unit time is called the <strong>mass flow rate</strong> and is denoted by . A fluid may flow in and out of the control volume and the mass flow rate of a fluid flowing in a pipe or a duct is proportional to the cross sectional area Ac of the pipe or duct, the density ρ and the velocity ‘v’ of the fluid. The mass flow rate through a differential area dAc can be expressed as:</p>
