  <h2><b>1. INTRODUCTION </b></h2> 
  <p>If one looks into the history of the development of Fracture Mechanics, the very first breakthrough occurred as early as in <b>1898</b>! This was when the first problem leading to stress concentration was solved by Kirsch. Kirsch solved the problem of an infinite plate with a circular hole for a tension strip.</p>

  <p class="center"><strong>Figure: Plate with circular hole (Kirsch: 1898) </strong></p> 
  <p>&nbsp;Following the solution of a plate with circular hole by Kirsch, it took <b><em>15 years </em></b>by Inglis (<b>1913</b>) to repeat the same problem with elliptical hole. For a tension strip with an elliptical hole, Inglis was able to determine that the near field stress was related to the far field stress by a factor (1+2a / b).</p>

  <p class="center"><b>Figure: Elliptical hole in a flat plate (Inglis: 1913) </b></p> 
  <p>&nbsp;The problems solved by Kirsch and Inglis have been very well covered in an undergraduate course on Strength of Materials and / or Theory of Plates and Shells. It should be noted that for a plate with an elliptical hole, the moment b -&gt; 0 (<em>b approaches 0 means that the ellipse becomes a crack</em>), the multiplication factor (1+2a / b) becomes infinity, which indicates;</p> 
  <p>i. the stresses become very high,</p> 
  <p>&nbsp;ii. the methodology of stress concentration to ascribe a crack is no longer valid.</p> 
  <p>&nbsp;Thus, one needs more improved mathematical approaches to handle the problem of crack because, in reality, stress can never approach infinity as plasticity will set in before that. The interpretation of Inglis meant that, once there is a crack, then, even for a small load, there will be infinite stress. This of course is not true because structures can have cracks embedded and might still not fracture.</p> 
  <p>&nbsp;The problem was solved by Griffith. Griffith was able to come out with a theory that energy is needed for crack growth. He formulated that an existing crack will grow provided that the total energy of the system is lowered by its growth. Through Griffith’s theory, one was able to appreciate that an existing crack will grow provided that the total energy of the system is lowered by its growth and eventually when the crack reaches its critical length, fracture occurs [unlike, what was depicted in the solution of Inglis].</p> 
  <p>&nbsp;Griffith’s work was confined to brittle materials and it was only in 1948, that Irwin extended the work to ductile materials.</p> 
  <p>&nbsp;In this article, I have attempted to elaborate in considerable detail the above contributions by Kirsch, Inglis, Griffith and Irwin which form the most significant contributions towards the subject of Fracture Mechanics. This article is organized as follows;</p> 
  <p>&nbsp;Section 2 of this article presents a review of Kirsch’s solution starting with a basic case of tension strip with a circular hole followed by more complex cases of biaxial tension and shear using superposition techniques. The solution for stress concentrations in finite width plates is also covered in this section.</p> 
  <p>&nbsp;Section 3 of this article presents a review of Inglis’ solution for a tension strip with elliptical hole. Important to note here is the limiting case of Inglis’ solution that predicted infinite stress and formed the motivation for Griffith’s theory concerning energy requirement for crack growth.</p> 
  <p>&nbsp;Summarized details of Griffith’s theory have been discussed in section 4 of this article. Concepts involving: energy release rare, surface energy,critical crack length, critical stress are discussed / explained in this section.</p> 
  <h2><strong>2. KIRSCH SOLUTION: PLATE WITH A CIRCULAR HOLE</strong></h2> 
  <p>&nbsp;</p> 
  <h3><strong>2.1 KIRSCH’S SOLUTION FOR A TENSION STRIP UNDER UNIAXIAL LOADING</strong></h3> 
  <p>&nbsp;Kirsch solution for the case of a plate with circular hole subjected to uniaxial tension is given below. The hole has a radius ‘a’ and the radial co-ordinate is ‘r’ which is meaningless if r&lt;a; θ = 0 aligns with the remote loading condition.</p>

  <h3><strong>Stress concentration factor, state of stress around the hole</strong></h3> 
  <p>&nbsp;</p> 
  <p>Stress field at the hole can be computed as;</p> 
  <p>At r = a, a / r =1, hence;</p> 
  <p>The radial stress σrr and the shear stress ζrθ = 0; because it is a free surface;</p> 
  <p>&nbsp;It is the hoop stress which needs attention;</p> 
  <p>&nbsp;At θ = 0, σθθ = -σ∞, i.e. the hoop stress is negative.</p> 
  <p>The hoop stress here is acting in the direction perpendicular to the applied load. Because the stretching is uniaxial in the far-field, the strain and the stress is negative in the perpendicular / transverse direction (due to Poisson’s effect)</p> 
  <p>Important to note, is the hoop stress at θ = +90 and θ = -90. Here;</p> 
  <p>&nbsp;σ = 3σ(see figure below) and the factor of stress ratio occurs. The ratio is called the <b>stress concentration factor. </b></p> 
  <p>&nbsp;It should be noted that the stress components at the hole are independent of the size of the hole itself. This is due to the fact that the plate is infinitely large so that the hole size is inconsequential relative to the size of the plate.</p>

  <h3><strong>2.3 SOLUTION FOR PLATE WITH CIRCULAR HOLE UNDER SHEAR LOADING</strong></h3> 
  <p>&nbsp;</p> 
  <p>Since, simple shear is a combination of simple tension along one of the diagonals (of the rectangular plate considered) and simple compression along the other diagonal, the state of stress corresponding to simple shear can be obtained by superimposing the effects of uniaxial tension and uniaxial compression at 45° as shown below;</p>

  <h2>3. INGLIS SOLUTION: PLATE WITH AN ELLIPTICAL HOLE</h2> 
  <p class="center">&nbsp;</p> 
  <h3>Elliptical coordinate system:&nbsp;</h3> 
  <p class="left">In geometry, the elliptical coordinate system is a 2 dimensional orthogonal co-ordinate system in which the coordinate lines are "confocal". Confocal means lines having the same foci (‘foci’ are special points with reference to which a variety of curves are constructed).</p> 
  <p>&nbsp;Elliptical coordinates are the generalisation of 2D polar coordinates suited to problems involving ellipses, just as polar co-ordinates are suited to problems involving circles. Elliptical coordinates are defined through the following equations;</p> 
  <div class="slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width"> 
   <img data-media-urn="urn:li:digitalmediaAsset:C5112AQF-D2NoPd4a4Q" src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5112AQF-D2NoPd4a4Q/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/0/1520191120423?e=1691625600&amp;v=beta&amp;t=tKs1TyU9jQ2vI6nnuY0979SYEsvF5TC55ewE4aekYrI">

  <p>The equations relate (x,y) to (c,β) with α being a fixed parameter based on the aspect ratio of the ellipse.</p>

  <h2>&nbsp;4. GRIFFITH’S THEORY</h2> 
  <h3>&nbsp;</h3> 
  <h3>Griffith’s dilemma:</h3> 
  <p>The immediate consequence of Inglis’ solution was that even for a small load, (<em>when 'b' approaches 0</em>) the crack would grow and break the component into pieces as the stress level approached infinity. This was (then) labelled as "Griffith’s dilemma" because a practical observation was that a solid might contain a crack and still remain intact. This could be possible only if some other mechanisms operate which help the solid to sustain solid forms – this was the key to Griffith’s analysis.</p> 
  <p>&nbsp;</p> 
  <h3>Concept of surface energy:</h3> 
  <p>Analogous to the surface tension in a liquid, all solid surfaces are associated with surface energies or free energies. These energies are developed because atoms close to a surface behave differently from atoms in the interior of a solid.</p> 
  <p>The interior atoms are attracted or repelled by the neighbouring atoms more or less uniformly from all directions. On the contrary, an atom on the (free) surface has no neighbouring atoms on one side of the surface, thus, resulting in a different equilibrium. In fact, the atoms at the free surface have to "re-adjust" themselves to form the equilibrium and this develops strain in the material close to the free surface. Such surface deformation requires energy and this is termed as "surface energy".&nbsp;</p> 
  <h3>&nbsp;</h3> 
  <h3>Griffith’s explanation:</h3> 
  <p>Griffith realised that a crack in a body will not grow unless energy was "released" to "overcome" the energy need to form two new surfaces: one below and one above the crack plane.</p> 
  <p>The surface energy of a material depends upon its material properties, the magnitude being small to the order of 1J/m^2.</p> 
  <p>&nbsp;The table below lists the surface energies of some common solids:</p>

  <h3>Griffith’s analysis:</h3> 
  <p>Let us consider a plate with no prior crack. It is pulled and then maintained in tension between 2 rigid supports as shown in the figure.</p> 
  <p>Now, with a knife a crack is cut at the corner of the plate with the crack plane normal to the tensile stress. A critical stage is reached when the crack starts growing on its own without further need of a knife. The length of the crack at which it starts growing on its "own" is called "critical crack length".</p>

  <h3>Prediction of critical crack length:</h3> 
  <p><em>[Critical crack length is the length beyond which the crack grows on its own]</em></p> 
  <p>&nbsp;To understand Griffith’s analysis, let us carry out an approximate analysis. The plate is chosen to have its dimensions much larger than the longest crack that is to be considered. Then, the stress at points far away from the crack is assumed to remain constant.</p> 
  <p>When the crack has grown into the solid to a depth "a", a region of the material adjacent to the free surface is unloaded and the strain energy is released. For the sake of convenience, a major area of the plate from where the strain energy is released may be taken a triangle on each side of the crack <em>(note: the assumption of triangular shape is assumed just to keep the algebra simple)</em>.</p> 
  <p>&nbsp;The height of the triangle is λ(2a) where λ is a constant. Then, the total release of energy is determined by multiplying the area of the triangles by the plate thickness "B" and the strain energy density σ2 / 2E. Thus, the released energy is given by;</p>

  <p>Energy release (ER) vs. Energy required (Es) for creating two new surfaces:</p> 
  <p>The above relations for the energy released (ER) and the energy required to create two new surfaces (ES) are plotted below. These relationships of ER and ES are plotted against an increasing crack length ‘a’ as shown in the figure below.</p>

  <h3 class="center">Figure: Variation of energy released and the required surface energy Es plotted against crack length</h3> 
  <p>&nbsp;</p> 
  <p>&nbsp;</p> 
  <p>It can be seen that ER increases parabolically with crack length ‘a’ whereas ES increases linearly. For an increase in crack length Δa, the increase in ER is smaller than the corresponding increase in ES. Thus, the energy releases is not sufficient to create two new surfaces. The crack would not grow on its own and would remain dormant.</p> 
  <p>&nbsp;If the length of the crack is increased further (in this case by the operator using the "knife", a stage is reached when the increase in ER is equal to the energy required to create two new surfaces. The crack length corresponding to this stage is known as the <b>"critical crack length" </b>because beyond this stage the crack continues to grow on its "own" without the operator having to use the knife. Beyond the critical crack length, the system loses it energy on its own, thus allowing the crack to grow. Beyond the critical crack length, the crack growth is spontaneous and catastrophic.</p> 
  <p>&nbsp;</p> 
  <h3>Mathematical expression for critical crack length:</h3> 
  <p>Thus, based on the above discussion, for the crack length to be critical, the rate of increase of ER should be greater than or equal to the energy required to create two new surfaces (ES).</p>
