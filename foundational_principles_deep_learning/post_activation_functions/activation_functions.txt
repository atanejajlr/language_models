Purpose of activation function:

The point of activation function is to introduce non-linearities to the data/ Almost all real-world data linear in nature, thus, if we want to deal with those datasets, we need models which are also non-linear so that the models can capture the kind of patterns in the data.
To understand this better, let us say we have a dataset as shown in the figure (see Figure: Non-Linear Dataset)

 

Suppose given this dataset, we have to construct a decision boundary i.e., a boundary separating the red and the green dots. Now, if were to use only a straight line to separate the green and the red points, the best we could do is to separate as shown in the Figure: Straight line (linear approach) to construct the decision boundary below:


Thus, the problem cannot be solved effectively using a linear approach and we will have to resort to non-linearity which helps to deal with such types of problems. The non-linear activation functions allow us to deal with non-linear data which makes the neural networks very powerful. 


Further, it may be underscored that since we’re just multiplying the inputs with the corresponding weights and adding them together, the problem remains a linear problem until we introduce non-linearities using non-linear activation functions.

Types of non-linear activation functions:

Some types of activation functions include,
•	Sigmoid Activation Function
•	Tan hyperbolic/ Hyperbolic Tangent activation function
•	ReLu activation function

These are illustrated in the figure below:

Using an activation function the neural network can achieve a non linear model as shown in the Figure: Decision boundary after using non-linear decision boundary
